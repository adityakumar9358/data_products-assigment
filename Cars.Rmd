## Understanding Gas Mileage

Using the `mtcars` dataset we plot can attempt to understand the relationship
of various factors to gas mileage (`mpg`).

We plot weight (`wt`) vs. mileage (`mpg`) spatially along the x/y axes. We 
visualize the number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colors and the amount of
horsepower (`hp`) as the size of an individual point in the plot.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```
